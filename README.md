# Selenium Drag & Drop

### Install packages
> pip install -r requirements.txt

### Scripts
- `broken.py` is an example of non-working Selenium Action Chains' drag and drop method.
- `fixed.py` is an example of drag and drop in Selenium using custom JavaScript code.

`script.js` was taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/druska/624501b7209a74040175#file-native_js_drag_and_drop_helper-js) and little modified for use in __Python__.
